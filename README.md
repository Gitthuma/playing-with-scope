Active learning: Playing with scope

Let's look at a real example to demonstrate scoping.

1. First, make a local copy of our function-scope.html example. This contains two functions called a() and b(), and three variables — x, y, and z — two of which are defined inside the functions, and one in the global scope. It also contains a third function called output(), which takes a single parameter and outputs it in a paragraph on the page.
2. Open the example up in a browser and in your text editor.
